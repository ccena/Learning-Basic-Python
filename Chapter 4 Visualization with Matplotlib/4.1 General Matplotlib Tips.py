"""
Matplotlib graphs your data on Figures (i.e., windows, Jupyter widgets, etc.),
each of which can contain one or more Axes (i.e., an area where points can be 
specified in terms of x-y coordinates (or theta-r in a polar plot, or x-y-z in
a 3D plot, etc.). One of Matplotlibâ€™s most important features is its ability to 
play well with many operating systems and graphics backends.
