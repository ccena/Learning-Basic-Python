"""
A pandas Series has no column labels, as it is just a single column of a 
DataFrame. A Series does have row labels.

print('The Pandas Series Object') # Templeate: pd.Series(data, index=index)
# A Pandas Series is a one-dimensional array of indexed data. It can be created
# from a list or array as follows:
data = pd.Series([0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0])
print(data)
print('')
# As we see in the preceding output, the Series wraps both a sequence of values 
# and a sequence of indices, which we can access with the values and index 
# attributes. The values are simply a familiar NumPy array:
print('Values of the data: ', data.values)
# The index is an array-like object of type pd.Index, which weâ€™ll discuss
# in more detail momentarily
print('Index of the Data: ', data.index)

# Like with a NumPy array, data can be accessed by the associated index via
# the familiar Python square-bracket notation:
print('Accessing the second element of the data, data[1]: ', data[1]) 
print('Accessing the second and third element of the data, data[1:3]:')   
print(data[1:3])
print('')
# As we will see, though, the Pandas Series is much more general and flexible 
# than the one-dimensional NumPy array that it emulates

print('Series as Generalized NumPy Array')
# =============================================================================
# The essential difference is the presence of the index: 
# While the NumPy array has an implicitly defined integer index used to access 
# the values, the Pandas Series has an explicitly defined index associated with 
# the values.
# =============================================================================
